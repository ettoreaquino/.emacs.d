# Introduction

A few years ago I realized most of the content I was studying in my Electrical Engineering undergrad was highly dependent upon software knowledge. Neither my professors nor my colleagues had a clue of that though. Why is that so? Why, for so many students and professors, coding was just a way of solving highly complex problems?

It would be presumptuous of me to point out the reasons of this behavior. After all, I've only being working as a software engineer for the past year or so. Nevertheless some clues start to appear in my mind, and most of them are connected to the lack of real world experience we manage to gather while in school.

Software became a critical part of our world, as you acknowledge it or not.  From very simple electronics and mobile applications, to the control of vehicle systems or even continental sized power systems, software is a key part that allows our civilization to work. Robert C. Martin \(Uncle Bob\), in a [Hakka Lab lecture](https://youtu.be/HhNIttd87xs?t=843), pointed out how software has penetrated in our lives and how we do not have enough people to deal with it.

So, does that mean everyone should start learning how to code? Or how to model real world problems or understand a bit of software architecture? Surely not. Does that mean engineers of all branches should learn how software is developed, where does it run, who develops it and how is it deployed? In my opinion, yes!
